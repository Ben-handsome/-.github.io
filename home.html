<h2>The view of the first excrement shovel official</h2>
<p>When a dog is at home alone, he or she is sleeping. If he or she is a very excited dog and doesn't live enough, he or she will be naughty when his or her owner is not at home. The common reaction is to demolish his or her home. My dog is at home during the day, only in the evening will he start to get excited, that is because in the evening I will take him out to play, very happy.</p>

<p>The dog's own Bai at home is actually very poor, many dogs are Du, in the absence of the owner, at home to find some of the popular Dao flavor of things, such as socks, shoes. My dog will wait at the door when I get off work. If I don't go home, he will sleep on my shoes. Sleeping with the smell of the owner is also a way to imagine the owner nearby.</p>

<p>If the dog is very obedient, defecate in a fixed place, do not damage things at home, can be directly closed at home, give enough food and water. If the dog is not very good, then before going to work during the day, you can put the dog in the cage, put water and food, and then put some small toys. If you have the conditions, you can give the dog a separate room, so that the activity space will be larger.</p>
