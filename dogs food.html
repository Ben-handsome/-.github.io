<h2>OK, we can start to learn</h2>
<p style="font-size:30px">The newborn puppies usually drink the colostrum of the female dog. If the newborn dog is produced by caesarean section, it can be artificially fed with goat milk powder. The lactation period of puppies is usually 45 days. When the period is about 45 days, the puppies can be fed with milk cake. Usually, in order to help the puppies better transition to the pup milk cake, this kind of weaning pup milk cake needs to be ground into powder, melted into water and mixed into paste. When the puppies are developing organs from 1 to 6 months old, it is recommended to feed the puppies' milk cake diet all the time. From 6 months old to 12 months old, when the puppies mainly develop bones and muscles, they can feed the growing puppies' diet at this time. After 12 months of age, dogs can be fed adult dog food at this time. Dogs may have some medical diseases after 8 years old. It is generally recommended that dogs be given some old dog food or prescription food at this time.</p>
